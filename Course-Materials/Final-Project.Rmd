# FW4133 Final project

## MDWFP monitoring

### MDWFP standardized electrofishing efforts 
  
* September to December
* Surface temperature: 60 to 75F
* Daytime
* 60 Hz DC recommended standardized to conductivity
* Driver and netter 
* Minimum 2 inch bar mesh
* Quantify effort
    * Time
    * Distance traveled
* Sampling
    * Stratification
    * Random sampling within strata




## Guidelines for the final report

The final report should be written as a technical report using accepted 
technical writing. 

The report is worth 200 points of your final grade. These points are 
appropriated among report components, turning in a first draft, and 
turning in the final draft that addresses revisions. 

Notes:  
1. Analyses will be limited to Largemouth bass and Bluegill!
2. Missing values in excel sheet are just that, missing values
3. Be sure to use the template and do not deviate from it! Scientific 
writing is all about uniformity! The template is [here](PDF/FW4133-report-template.docx)


## Breakdown specifics

Report components (140 pts total)

1. Executive summary (15 pts) covering the main results  
2. Introduction (15 pts) that covers a bit on the life history of the 
species being evaluated (~2 paragraphs) and a final paragraph that goes 
over the objectives and lay out of the report) 
3. Methods (40 pts)  
    1. Study area detailing the study waterbody, also includes any 
    relevant fishing regulations specific to Largemouth bass and 
    Bluegill.  
    1. Sampling-paragraph is provided below
    1. Size structure and condition
    1. Age structure and mortality
    1. Assessing fishery
4. Results (70 pts total)
    1. Catch data  
        1. Catch per effort (10 pts)  
    1. Size structure and condition  
        1. Length-weight (estimating a and b) (10 pts)  
        1. PSD (traditional and incremental) (10 pts)  
        1. Condition (K and Wr) (10 pts)  
    1. Age structure and mortality  
        1. Age-length (10 pts)  
        1. Catch curve & estimating instantaneous mortality  (10 pts)  
    1. Assessing fishery  
        1. Yield per recruit (10 pts)  
    1. Discussion (5 bonus pnts).  Discuss what you found to be 
    challenging in terms of the data and how it was collected.
    Offer suggestions of how to improve the data collected.   

First draft (10 pts)

## Timeline

* March 27: Go over report and expectations
* April 22: First draft due in word format, Presentation overview, 
reports will be returned with comments within 48 hours 
* April 24: Group presentations
* May 4: Final draft due

## Methods paragraph

_Mississippi Department of Fisheries Wildlife and Parks personnel 
collected fish using standardized boat electrofishing at randomly 
selected transects. All sampling efforts were conducted during the fall 
when surface waters were 60 to 75 F during daytime hours using 60 Hz 
direct current. The total amount of time electricity was applied to the 
water in seconds (i.e., box time) was used to quantify electrofishing 
effort. Personnel consisted of 2 people, a driver and a netter. The 
netter used a net with a mesh bar size of 1 inch. If possible, total 
length and weight of collected fish were measured to the nearest 
millimeter and gram respectively. A random subsample of fish were aged 
and used to quantify age structure and in catch curve analyses._
