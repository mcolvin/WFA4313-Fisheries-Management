## Instructor notes

### Preliminaries before laboratory

[&emsp;] Update due date for responses  
[&emsp;] Go over notes from previous time and update lab  
[&emsp;] Set up a batch of 100 plastic worms with ~25 large worms and 75 small worms  
[&emsp;] Determine true weight and mean weight  
[&emsp;] Check google form to enter responses for grading   

### Materials
[&emsp;] Laboratory instructor notes (1)  
[&emsp;] Lab print outs, enough for class  
[&emsp;] Post it notes  
[&emsp;] Scales, with precision to at least 0.1    
[&emsp;] Wash tubs, 2; to hold water and worms  
[&emsp;] Weighing boats  
[&emsp;] Envelopes with card inside stating "You overestimated the population weight!"  
[&emsp;] Calculator  
[&emsp;] Laptop    
[&emsp;] Excel spreadsheet set up to calculate numbers for summary tables.  
[&emsp;] Paper towels  


## Methods

1. Set up laptop with grid for filling in with 
2. Set up scales, tubs, worms, and weigh boats  


## Other Notes

* TAs role is to keep track and enter data in excel spreadsheet and provide results for exercise tables.  


## Notes

* Range of worm weights from previous years was 0-15
 {0.4 to 11.3 grams actually}

## Notes for next time

* Fix exercise 2 where missing weights are required, may have swapped datasheets?
* Need to remove some weights for datasheet 2... or combine 2 and 3
Initial items on hard copy when done and committed to repository.
