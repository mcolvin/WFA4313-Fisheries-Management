# WFA4133 Fisheries Science Laboratory 1

## Laboratory overview

Sampling is a fundamental aspect of fisheries science and management.
Samples are used to estimate quantities, which in turn are used to
 understand (i.e., science), manage, and regulate fisheries.
In the simplest case fish length, weight, or both is measured and used
 to estimate a mean.
However in fisheries, weight is most commonly measured and used to
 estimate biomass.
This is because weight is easy to measure in bulk and therefore fishery
 landings are measured as biomass. 
The image below, albeit extreme, illustrates what catch may look like! 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("media/lotsoffish.jpg")
```

How do we measure relevant metrics of the catch when there are that many fish?
*Statistics!*
In statistics we sample a larger population to *estimate* useful bits
 of information.
The objectives of this laboratory are to further your understanding of

* Sampling frames
* Simple sampling
* Estimation
* Bias

This laboratory will consist of 3 exercises designed to simulate
 common data collection encountered while performing fisheries tasks
 and varying estimated statistics.
This lab is worth 10 points.

## Exercise 1. Estimating total weight of a population: a grab sample

In this example you will estimate the total weight of a population.
In this exercise there are 100 fishes in the tub.
This is the population.
Let’s get to it. 

1. Take a grab sample of 5 plastic fishes in grams
2. Tare the digital scale
3. Weigh them simultaneously
4. Record the on your index card and report your weight to the instructor

Weight of 5 fishes:___________

5. Estimate the weight of the entire population by multiplying the
 weight above by 20, record it on your card, and record it below.

Estimated weight of the population:___________

6. Go to white board and color in the histogram cell with your biomass estimate. 
7. Record the histogram for the class
 derived data on the graph above. The instructor will help you work
 through this on the white board. 
8. Fill in the table below with the summary statistics for the
 histogram you created in Figure 1 (these will be calculated by the instructor). 

| Metric       	| Value 	|
|--------------	|:-----:	|
| Observations 	|       	|
| Mean         	|       	|
| Median       	|       	|
| Minimum      	|       	|
| Maximum      	|       	|
| Range        	|       	|
| Variance     	|       	|


Ok, 5 fish really is not that many relative to the 100 fish in the tub.
Let's see what happens when we take 10 fish.

1. Repeat the steps above but for 10 fish, but use figure 2 for the histogram.

Weight of 10 fishes:___________

2. Estimate the weight of the entire population by multiplying
the weight above by 10 and record it below.

Estimated weight of the population:___________

3. Fill in the table below with the summary statistics for the
 histogram you created in Figure 2 (these will be calculated by the instructor). 
Statistics for the biomass estimate based off of a grab sample of 10 fish.

| Metric       	| Value 	|
|--------------	|:-----:	|
| Observations 	|       	|
| Mean         	|       	|
| Median       	|       	|
| Minimum      	|       	|
| Maximum      	|       	|
| Range        	|       	|
| Variance     	|       	|


## Exercise 2. Simple sampling

The previous approaches resulted in 20 or so individual
 biomass estimates.
However there is no way to estimate the variance of the sample.
This is because we sampled 5 or 10 fish in a grab sample and replaced
 the fish in the tub.
To remedy the lack of variance, a common practice in fisheries is to
 take measurements on the first 30 fish or so in your catch.
Let’s simulate this and how you can estimate the total weight
 of the catch by doing the following:

1. Remove a plastic fish from the tub and weigh it 
2. Report the weight to the instructor
3. Record the weight value below, on the card provided, and shade in the right cell on the white board.
4. Place the processed fish in the tub off to the side
5. Repeat until you have processed 2 fish

fish weight 1:__________

fish weight 2:__________

6. Record the histogram for the class in Figure 3 towards the end of this document.
7. Fill in the table below with the summary statistics for
 the histogram above (your instructor will provide the estimates).

| Metric       	| Value 	|
|--------------	|:-----:	|
| Observations 	|       	|
| Mean         	|       	|
| Median       	|       	|
| Minimum      	|       	|
| Maximum      	|       	|
| Range        	|       	|
| Variance     	|       	| 
 
8. Estimate the total weight of the population by multiplying the class
 mean by 100. 
 
Estimated biomass:__________  




## Exercise 3. Stratified sampling

You may have noticed something in the histogram generated in exercise 3.
Also we should have found that doing grab samples and the first 30 or so fish
 results in biased biomass estimates.
One way to minimize bias of biomass estimates is to stratify the samples.
In this case we can stratify by size, little and big fish.
Let’s simulate this and how you can estimate the total weight
 of the catch and see if we can do better!
 
1. Remove a large fish from the tub and weigh it 
2. Report the weight to the instructor
3. Record the weight value below, on the card provided, and shade in the right cell on the white board.
4. Place the processed fish in the tub off to the side
5. Repeat until you have processed 2 fish, a large and small one

Large fish weight 1:__________  

Small fish weight 2:__________

6. Fill in the table below reflecting the summary statistics for
 large and small fish (your instructor will provide the estimates).
 
| Metric       	| Value (lg)| Value (sm)|
|--------------	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
| Observations 	|       	|       	|
| Mean         	|       	|       	|
| Median       	|       	|       	|
| Minimum      	|       	|       	|
| Maximum      	|       	|       	|
| Range        	|       	|       	|
| Variance     	|       	|       	|
 
7. Estimate the weighted average of the population by multiplying as 
 the large fish mean x 0.25 + Small fish mean x 0.75. There are 75 small fish and 25 big fish.

Weighted mean:__________  
 
8. Estimate the population biomass by multiplying the weighted mean by 100 and record below.

Estimated biomass:__________
