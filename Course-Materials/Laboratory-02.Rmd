# WFA4133 Fisheries Science Laboratory 2


## Laboratory overview

This lab is 3 exercises designed to simulate what a typical fisheries professional is 
 required to do with sampling data, from data entry to preliminary analysis. 


1.	The first exercise is a typical situation where data is collected by sampling a small impoundment for bluegill and largemouth bass. 
2.	The second exercise works through a commonly encountered issue, where weight is only taken on a subset of fish due to time constraints.  
3.	The third exercise is another typical situation where data is collected to assess the condition of a sport fish population. 

For this lab you will be randomly divided into teams that you will remain in for the rest of class and expected to work collaboratively through
    the class exercises. You may or may not work together to answer the lab question for each exercise.
<u>NOTE: Your answers to the questions should be written in your own words.</u> This lab is worth 20 points.

## EXERCISE 1: How do we quantify size structure?


This exercise simulates what you can expect as a practicing fisheries professional.
Your team has returned from sampling a small impoundment for largemouth bass and bluegill.
Using the datasheets provided perform the following
 (NOTE: all files are located and should be saved to the folder entitled "Lab 2-> Exercise 1"
 located on the desktop; this is the folder you unzipped).
 
### Instructions

#### Data entry and upload
1.	Enter the data from the datasheet into the spreadsheet entitled “Exercise 1.csv” in folder “Exercise 1”.
 <u>Be sure to enter Largemouth Bass as LMB and Bluegill as BLG, no lower case!</u>
 There are column names already already set up in the spreadsheet, use those.  
1.	Periodically save the csv file. (NOTE excel will warn you that there may be incompatible features, just click yes and carry on) 
1.	Look over the data entered to ensure there were no mistakes due to data entry!
1.	Save the final data in the csv file in the folder "lab 2 -> Exercise 1"
1.	Open Chrome, and upload the data to the Exercise 1 portion of the Lab app.  
1.	Once the data is loaded, it will appear to the right
1.	Look over the uploaded data and ensure it looks OK!

#### Generating a length histogram

Length histograms can reveal clues about a population's growth and structure.
However some of the structure can be obscured by how the histogram is constructed.
Let's explore this.

1.	On the left hand side, select "largemouth bass" as the species from the filter fish species dropdown
1.	The application will generate a preliminary histogram of your length data, visible in the “Length histogram” tab  
1.	Set the binning interval using the input box to generate a histogram.
 Use any bin sizes, your choice, and record your final choice here __________. 
1.	Save your final histogram to the folder "lab 2 -> Exercise 1".  This is done by right clicking on the histogram image
1.	Repeat steps 1 – 4 for bluegill

#### Calculating Size structure indices from length data

1. On the left hand side, select "largemouth bass" as the species from the filter fish species dropdown.
1. Enter the appropriate length values from Table 1.1 below to calculate PSD frequencies in the input box on the left hand side.
 NOTE: Tables are located at the end of this packet.    
1. Write the number of fish in each length category in Table 1.1 below.  NOTE:  These counts are located in the PSD Counts tab
1. Repeat steps 1 – 4 for bluegill
1. As a group using whatever tools you have at your disposal, calculate traditional (PSD-X) and incremental (PSD-X-Y) values for Largemouth
 Bass and Bluegill given the numbers you recorded in Table 1.1 and 1.2 and record them in the corresponding table columns.
 PSD equations can be found below.
 NOTE:  incremental counts can be calculated from traditional counts by subtracting number of fish in the next largest
 cell from current cell.  For example, if there are 100 stock fish and 20 quality fish, the number of fish that are stock – quality sized is 100-20 = 80.  The number of fish in the trophy size class is always the same for traditional or incremental.
1. Using the counts in Tables 1. 2, calculate the incremental proportion stock density to complete Table 1.2 below.
See the below for PSD equations. 

#### TRADITIONAL PSD EQUATION

$PSD-X=\frac{\text{Number of fish}\ge \text{ specified length}}{\text{Number of fish }\ge \text{ stock length}}\cdot 100$

#### INCREMENTAL PSD EQUATION
  
$PSD-X-Y=\frac{\text{Number of fish}\,\text{in bin}}{\text{Number of fish }\ge \text{ stock length}}\cdot 100$


EXERCISE 1: QUESTIONS (6 POINTS TOTAL)

1.1) What was the binning interval you used to finalize your preliminary length-frequency figure for 2016 and why did
 you select that interval? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

1.2) Is there anything about your Largemouth Bass or Bluegill histograms that does not make sense?
If so what is it? What could have caused it? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

1.3) The impoundment is owned by a local muncipality and they would like to know what type of fishery and fishing could be expected.
Using PSD-X values calculated for the Largemouth Bass and Bluegill and make a recommendation for a fishery type and why you would suggest
 that classification.
See Table 1.3 in the appendix for PSD values for various Largemouth Bass and Bluegill systems. (2 points)

## EXERCISE 2: How do we estimate weight and biomass?

In the sampling, length-weight data was commonly taken for the first 30 fish processed and
 then only length data was taken.
An allometric equation for the length-weight relationship is then used to estimate the weight for
 the fish with missing weights.
(NOTE: all files are located and should be saved to the folder entitled "Lab 2-> Exercise 2"
  located on the desktop):

### INSTRUCTIONS

#### Data entry and upload

1.	Enter the data from the datasheet into the spreadsheet entitled “Exercise 2”.
There are column names already in the spreadsheet, use those.
 <u>Be sure to enter Largemouth Bass as LMB and Bluegill as BLG, no lower case!</u>
 There are column names already already set up in the spreadsheet, use those.  
1.	Periodically save the csv file. (NOTE excel will warn you that there may be incompatible features, just click yes and carry on) 
3.	Look over the data entered to ensure there were no mistakes!
4.	Save the final data in the csv file in the folder "lab 2 -> Exercise 2"
5.	Open Chrome and then upload data to the Exercise 2 portion of the Lab app.  
6.	Once the data is loaded, it will  appear to the right
1.	Look over the uploaded data and ensure it looks OK!

#### Evaluating length-weight relationships

1.	Once the data has been uploaded click on the Length-Weight plot tab to view the length-weight relationship.  
2.	Using the input boxes for $a^\prime$ and $b$ on the left hand side of the app, enter values for $a^\prime$ and $b$
 from Table 2.1 below and record the sums of square residuals in Table 2.1. 
3.	After running the first 6 combinations of $a^\prime$ and $b$ in Table 2.1, as a team come up with 2 more combinations
 to evaluate, not equal to the last values of $a^\prime$ and $b$.
 Record the values of $a^\prime$ and $b$ you evaluated as well as the resulting sums of squares residuals in Table 2.1.  
4.	Run the final combination of $a^\prime$ and $b$ located in the last row of Table 2.1 and record the resulting sums of
 squares residuals in Table 2.1.

What was the combination of $a^\prime$ and $b$ in Table 2.1 that had the lowest sums of squares residuals?

$a^\prime$:__________	$b$:__________

The "Length-weight equation estimates" tab provides the actual best fit estimates of $a^\prime$ and $b$ (i.e., the estimate that
 minimizes the sum squared residuals).
Record those values below

$a^\prime$:__________	$b$:__________

Using the values of $a^\prime$ and $b$ for the best fit above and your spreadsheet for exercise 2, estimate the weight
 values for fish without weights.
This is done by typing the allometric scaling equation into your spreadsheet as (=10^($a^\prime$)*length^$b$).
Recall the length weight relationship is $W=a\cdot L ^b$.
Then calculate the mean weight of the sample and record below, making sure to save your spreadsheet once you are done.
Use the =average(…) function in excel to calculate average weight.

Mean sample weight: ____________

Suppose there are 10,000 fish in the lake, estimate the biomass in the lake as [mean weight]x[10000]

Total lake biomass:__________

#### EXERCISE 2 QUESTIONS (10 POINTS TOTAL)

2.1. Was there evidence for isometric ($b = 3$) or allometric ($b \neq 3$)  scaling of weight with length in the largemouth bass population?
Given the value of $b$ for the sample, how would you expect the weight of fish to change
 with length? Values less than 3 result in a fish getting more fusiform as it gets larger, greater than 3 it becomes more plump. (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

2.2. Do you believe the estimate of total biomass?
 Do you think it would be reasonable to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the biomass estimate
 based on the sample variance? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

2.3. Once weight has been estimated for the entire sample, would it be reasonable to calculate $W_{r}$
 for all the Largemouth Bass in the sample?  Why or why not? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

2.4. This analysis assumes that all fish are captured equally.
Would there be an effect of size selective  capture which resulted in few, if any, large fish captured? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

2.5. How does $a^\prime$ relate to a in the length-weight equation?
HINT:how does $a$ equal $a^\prime$. (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="page-break-after:always;"></p>

## EXERCISE 3: Relative weight

A more typical sampling event would require biologists to collect length weight data on all the
 largemouth bass collected.
Your team has returned from sampling a different small impoundment for largemouth bass.
Using the datasheet provided perform the following (NOTE: all files are located and should be
 saved to the folder entitled "Lab 2-> Exercise 3" located on the desktop):

### INSTRUCTIONS

#### Data entry and upload
1.	Enter the data from the datasheet into the spreadsheet entitled “Exercise 3”.
 There are column names already in the spreadsheet, use those.
 <u>Be sure to enter Largemouth Bass as LMB and Bluegill as BLG, no lower case!</u>
 There are column names already already set up in the spreadsheet, use those.  
1.	Periodically save the csv file. (NOTE excel will warn you that there may be incompatible features, just click yes and carry on) 
3. Look over the data entered to ensure there were no mistakes!
4. Save the final data in the csv file in the folder "lab 2 -> Exercise 3"
5. Upload data to the exercise 3 portion of the Lab app.  
6. Once the data is loaded, it will  appear to the right
1.	Look over the uploaded data and ensure it looks OK!

#### Evaluating $W_{r}$

1.	Once the data is uploaded enter the $a^\prime$ and $b$ parameters for the Largemouth Bass
 standard weight equation here: $${{W}_{s}}={{10}^{-5.528}}\cdot {{L}^{3.273}}$$ 
2.	Using the length weight equation above calculate the $W_{r}$ for a the <u>5th</u> Largemouth Bass in the dataset as  

${{W}_{r}}=\frac{Weigh{{t}_{observed}}}{Weigh{{t}_{s}}}\cdot 100$

$W_{r}$: __________ 

#### Evaluating $W_{r}$ by fish length

The tab $W_{r}$ versus length plots $W_{r}$ values for the same versus fish length.  Save the plot to your folder by right clicking on it.  

#### Evaluating $W_{r}$ by fish length category

Plotting $W_{r}$ by length category can also be an effective way of interpreting $W_{r}$ values.
The 5 cells, stock, quality, preferred, memorable, and trophy sizes are commonly used to aggregate $W_{r}$ values.
The tab “Wr boxplot” provides a box of $W_{r}$ values by length group.  Make sure the correct values of $a^\prime$ and $b$ for the
 standard weight equation are in the input boxes.  

1. Make sure the appropriate PSD length are entered in the input box on the right
2. Click on the “Wr boxplot” tab 
3. A boxplot should be present for your data.
4. Save the boxplot to the Exercise 3 folder by right clicking on the image.  


EXERCISE 3. QUESTIONS (4 POINTS TOTAL)

3.1) How did the best fit line from Exercise 2 and the standard weight line compare to each other? (2 points)

<br><br><br><br><br>



3.2) Do the boxplot help interpretation of $W_{r}$ compared to the scatterplot of $W_{r}$ values by fish length?  If so, why? (2 points)
