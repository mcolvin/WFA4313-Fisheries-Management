Linking age and size
* Size is related to age: How do we go from age to length?
    * Growth models predict length at age
    * How do we age fish?
* Management application: PDSG predicting age from length
    * Problem: increase age-0 and age-1 recruitment 
    * Alternatives: shallow water habitat
    * 
* Growth issues
    * Stunting of fish in populations
    * Density dependent
    * Density independent


* Management alternatives
    * Winter water level drawdowns to increase bass predation on bluegills
    * stocking additional predators
    * Draining the pond and re-stocking
    * Seining to remove excess stunted bluegills 
    * Rotenone and start over
    * weed control: pathway 1) reduced feeding rates in lakes with dense macrophytes and pathway 2) increase macrophyte density 
    reduces predator foraging efficiency by providing refuge for prey
    * Supplemental feeding
    * stocking with largemouth black bass, 
    * Fertilization to increase the food supply, and 
    * Heavy fishing to reduce the number of fish
    * Remove LMB-rule of thumb is around 10 lbs per acre and then 15 if no change, continue increasing rate until change occurs
